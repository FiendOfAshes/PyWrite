# PyWrite - A simple text editor using Python
Just built this for some practice with file handling and using libraries like os and pathlib and building a small, single-file application with tkinter. 

## Problems
1. Doesn't really have any functionality that tracks whether an opened file is saved or not. The user has to manually save the file to ensure any changes remain.
